# What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing provides on-demand access to these services, enabling users to rapidly scale up or down their usage of computing resources as needed, paying only for what they use.

### A quick history of cloud computing

It wasn't until the mid-2000s that the concept of cloud computing began to take shape.

One of the early pioneers of cloud computing was Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched in 2006. AWS offered a range of cloud-based computing services, including virtualized servers, storage, and databases, that businesses could use to quickly and easily provision computing resources over the internet.

### What is IaaS, PaaS, SaaS?

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS provides users with virtualised computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. The user is responsible for managing the operating system, applications, and data running on top of the infrastructure. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides users with a platform for building and deploying applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The provider takes care of the operating system, server software, and other infrastructure components, allowing the user to focus on developing and deploying their application. Examples of PaaS providers include Google App Engine and Heroku.

Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS provides users with access to software applications over the internet, typically through a web browser. The provider hosts and manages the software, and users typically only use the sofware not manipulate it. Examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce and Dropbox.

### Public Cloud

A public cloud refers to a cloud computing model in which cloud services are provided over the internet by a third-party cloud service provider. In a public cloud, the underlying infrastructure and resources are shared among multiple customers, often referred to as tenants or users. 

Multi-tenancy: Public cloud resources are shared among multiple customers, with each customer's data and applications logically isolated from one another. The resources are dynamically allocated and provisioned to meet the needs of different customers.

Public cloud services are particularly popular due to their cost-effectiveness, agility, and ease of use.

### Private Cloud

A private cloud refers to a cloud computing model in which cloud services are provided within a dedicated and isolated infrastructure, exclusively for a single organization or entity. Unlike a public cloud, a private cloud is not shared with other organisations or the general public.

Key characteristics of a private cloud include:

- Dedicated infrastructure
- Isolation: The private cloud is isolated from external users and organisations
- Customisation and control
- Enhanced security

### Hybrid cloud

Hybrid cloud refers to a cloud computing environment that combines the use of both public and private clouds, allowing organisations to access the benefits of both models. In a hybrid cloud, the public and private clouds remain distinct entities but are connected and operate as a single, integrated infrastructure.

Data and Application Portability: Hybrid cloud environments enable organizations to move workloads, data, and applications between public and private clouds based on their specific needs, cost considerations, and performance requirements.

Enhanced Security and Compliance: Hybrid cloud allows organisations to maintain control over their sensitive data and applications while leveraging the security measures and compliance capabilities provided by the private cloud.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: Hybrid cloud environments can be designed to support robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategies by replicating data between the two cloud services.

### What is Operating Expenditure? (OPEX)

Operating Expenditure (OPEX) refers to the ongoing expenses that a business incurs in order to maintain its operations and generate revenue. These expenses are incurred regularly and are necessary to keep the business running, such as salaries and wages, rent, utilities, insurance, marketing, and maintenance costs.

### What is Capital Expenditure? (CAPEX)

OPEX is different from Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), which refers to the expenses a business incurs to acquire or upgrade its physical assets such as buildings, equipment, and machinery. While CAPEX involves one-time or infrequent expenses, OPEX is a recurring cost that is incurred regularly as part of the business operations.

### Which is preferable? and how does the cloud allow businesses to transfer to spending more on the preferred one?

The preference between operating expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) can vary depending on the specific circumstances and objectives of a business. However, cloud computing can provide certain advantages that enable businesses to shift their spending towards OPEX.

Here's how the cloud allows businesses to transfer to spending more on OPEX:

Pay-as-you-go Model: Cloud service providers typically operate on a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model. Instead of making large upfront investments in hardware, software, and infrastructure (CAPEX), businesses can pay for cloud services based on their actual usage (OPEX). This allows them to align their expenses with their actual needs and scale up or down as required, resulting in more predictable and flexible spending.

Reduced Infrastructure Costs: By moving to the cloud, businesses can eliminate or significantly reduce these infrastructure costs. They can leverage the provider's infrastructure.

Operational Efficiency: Cloud computing provides businesses with access to scalable and managed services. This eliminates the need for businesses to invest in setting up and maintaining their own infrastructure, platforms, and software.
